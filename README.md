# Ouroboros Numbers
Generates Ouroboros Number (AKA
[Parasitic Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_number))

The Ouroboros is an ancient emblem of Egypt and Greece that's shown as a serpent
or dragon with its tail in its mouth, continually devouring itself, and
constantly being reborn. Traditionally it represents the cyclical recreation of
life and death.

This puzzle is about numbers that work like an Ouroboros. We're looking for
numbers where the head of the number devours the tail through simple
multiplication.

Here's an example. Here we're looking for a number that, when multiplied by 4,
moves the last number to the front, leaving the rest of the digits unchanged.
Here's the shortest number where that will work:

102564 * 4 = 410256
